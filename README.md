Hi, I'm a backend engineer passionate about programming! I enjoy the sense of achievement that comes from gradually solving challenges while coding. I'm currently focused on developing with Python, and I also love learning new technologies. I record my learning experiences in technical blog posts, and I'm currently striving towards becoming a full-stack engineer.
